# HashWithIndifferentAccessDuplicateWarning

The ruby allow different value between string key and symbol key.

```
{x: 21, 'x'=>42}
=> {:x=>21, "x"=>42}
```
But, when we convert this hash to HashWithIndifferentAccess, we lost one side value.

```
ActiveSupport::HashWithIndifferentAccess.new({x: 21, 'x'=>42})
=> {"x"=>42}
```

When we create duplicate key's hash, ruby warning message.

```
irb(main):010:0> {x: 21, 'x':42}
(irb):10: warning: key :x is duplicated and overwritten on line 10
=> {:x=>42}
```

This gem show warning message when HashWithIndifferentAccess overwritten a key.

```
ActiveSupport::HashWithIndifferentAccess.new({x: 21, 'x'=>42})
warning: key :x and 'x' is duplicated and overwritten
=> {"x"=>42}
```
